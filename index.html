      <h2>COFFEE</h2>
        <p>A brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries of the <em>Coffea</em> plant.</p>
        <p>Coffee plants are grown in over 70 countries in the world, but most coffee comes from regions around the equator.</p>
        <p>Coffee drinking is thought to have originated in Yemen during the 15th century.</p>

      <h2>ESPRESSO</h2>
      <p><strong>coffee brewed under pressure</strong></p>
      <p>Espresso is a concentrated coffee beverage. You can make it by pushing a small amount of near-boiling water through finely ground, compacted coffee beans.</p>
      <p>Espresso is, as a result, thicker and more concentrated than regular coffee. It also forms the base for lattes, cappuccinos, macchiatos, and Americanos.</p>
      <p>Contrary to what you may think, any bean or roasting level can be used to make espresso.</p>

      <h2>LATTE</h2>
      <p>espresso + steamed milk</p>
      <p>In English, it's called a latte, but that's just a shortened form of the Italian <em>caffè  latte</em>, meaning "milk coffee".</p>
      <p>Caffè lattes and latte macchiatos are different. With caffè lattes, milk is added to espresso, rather than the other way around, so there is a stronger coffee flavor in caffè lattes.</p>
      <p>A latte macchiato is steamed milk with half a shot of espresso poured over it.</p>

      <h2>CAPPUCCINO</h2>
      <p>espresso + hot milk + foamed milk</p>
      <p>Cappuccinos are like lattes, but they have much less steamed milk. Espresso is poured into a cup, followed by about an equal amount of hot milk, and the top third is milk foam.</p>
      <p>Sometimes they are topped with cinnamon.</p>
      <p>Caffè macchiatos, by the way, consist of espresso with a small amount of milk.</p>

      <h2>FLAT WHITE</h2>
      <p>espresso + microfoam (steamed milk)</p>
      <p>Flat whites originated in Australia. They are prepared by pouring microfoam over a single shot (in Australia) or a double ristretto shot of espresso (in New Zealand). Microfoam is just steamed milk with a glossy or velvety consistency because of the small bubbles in it.</p>
      <p>The distinguishing factor when it comes to cappuccinos and flat whites is the microfoam. Cappuccinos have a thick layer of foam, but a flat white has milk or microfoam but no froth, so the layer of microfoam in a flat white is "flat".</p>
      <p>A Ristretto shot is a short shot of espresso coffee made with the normal amount of coffee but half the amount of water.</p>

      <h2>AMERICANO</h2>
      <p>espresso + hot water</p>
      <p>A caffè americano, or Americano for short, is espresso with added hot water.</p>
